# Joining Data In SQL

## 1: Introducing Joins
```sql
SELECT *
  FROM facts f
       INNER JOIN cities c
         ON c.facts_id = f.id
LIMIT 10
```

## 2: Understanding Inner Joins
```sql
SELECT c.*, f.name AS country_name
  FROM facts f
       INNER JOIN cities c
          ON c.facts_id = f.id
LIMIT 5
```

## 3: Practicing Inner Joins
```sql
SELECT f.name AS country,
       c.name AS capital_city
  FROM facts f
       INNER JOIN cities c
          ON c.facts_id = f.id
 WHERE capital = 1
```

## 4: Left Joins
```sql
SELECT f.name AS country,
       f.population
  FROM facts f
       LEFT JOIN cities c 
         ON c.facts_id = f.id
 WHERE c.facts_id IS NULL
```

## 5: Right Joins and Outer Joins
```sql
SELECT f.name country, c.name city
FROM cities c
FULL OUTER JOIN facts f ON f.id = c.facts_id
LIMIT 5;
```

## 6: Finding the Most Populous Capital Cities
```sql
SELECT c.name as capital_city,
       f.name as country,
       c.population
  FROM facts f
       LEFT JOIN cities c
          ON c.facts_id = f.id
 WHERE c.capital = 1
ORDER BY 3 DESC
LIMIT 10
```

## 7: Combining Joins with Subqueries
```sql
SELECT c.name AS capital_city,
       f.name AS country,
       c.population
  FROM facts f
       JOIN (
             SELECT *
               FROM cities
              WHERE capital = 1
            ) c
         ON c.facts_id = f.id
 WHERE c.population > 10000000
ORDER BY 3 DESC
```

## 8: Challenge: Complex Query with Joins and Subqueries
```sql
SELECT f.name AS country,
       c.city_pop AS urban_pop,
       f.population AS total_pop,
       (CAST(c.city_pop AS FLOAT) /f.population) AS urban_pct       
  FROM facts AS f
       JOIN (SELECT facts_id, name, SUM(population) AS city_pop 
               FROM cities 
             GROUP BY facts_id) c
         ON c.facts_id = f.id
WHERE CAST(c.city_pop AS FLOAT) /f.population > .5
ORDER BY 4 ASC
```
