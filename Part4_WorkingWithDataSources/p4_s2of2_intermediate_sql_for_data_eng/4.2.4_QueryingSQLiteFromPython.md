# Querying SQLite from Python

## 1: Overview
Two ways to interact with SQLite
- SQLite 3 Python Module
- SQLite Shell

## 2: Intro to the Data

https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors

The Column Descriptors
- Rank: The major's rank by median earnings
- Major_code: The major's code or ID
- Major: The name of the major
- Major_category: The broader category the major belongs to
- Total: The total number of people who studied the major
- Sample_size: The sample size (unweighted) of graduates with full time jobs
- Men: The number of male graduates
- Women: The number of female graduates
- ShareWomen: Women as a proportion of the total number of graduates (a number ranging from 0 to 1)
- Employed: The number of employed graduates


## 3: Connecting to the Database
```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('jobs.db')
```

## 4: Intro to Cursor Objects and Tuples
```python
N/A
```

## 5: Working With Sequences of Values as Tuples
```python
N/A
```

## 6: Creating a Cursor and Running a Query
```python
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect("jobs.db")
cursor = conn.cursor()

query = "select major from recent_grads;"
cursor.execute(query)
majors = cursor.fetchall()
print(majors[0:3])
```

## 7: Execute as a Shortcut for Running a Query
```python
conn = sqlite3.connect("jobs.db")
query = "select * from recent_grads;"
conn.execute(query).fetchall()
```

## 8: Fetching a Specific Number of Results
```python
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect("jobs.db")
cursor = conn.cursor()

query = "SELECT Major, Major_category FROM recent_grads;"
five_results = conn.execute(query).fetchmany(5)
print(five_results)
```

## 9: Closing the Database Connection
```python
conn = sqlite3.connect("jobs.db")

conn.close()
```

## 10: Practice
```python
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect("jobs2.db")

query = "SELECT Major FROM recent_grads ORDER BY Major DESC;"
reverse_alphabetical = conn.execute(query).fetchall()
print(reverse_alphabetical)
conn.close()
```
