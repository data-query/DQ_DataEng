# Intermediate Joins in SQL

## 1: Working with Larger Databases
```sql
N/A
```

## 2: Joining Three Tables
```sql
SELECT il.track_id
       ,t.name AS track_name
       ,mt.name AS track_type
       ,il.unit_price
       ,il.quantity
  FROM invoice_line il
       INNER JOIN track t 
          ON t.track_id = il.track_id
       INNER JOIN media_type mt 
          ON mt.media_type_id = t.media_type_id
WHERE invoice_id = 4;
```

## 3: Joining More Than Three Tables
```sql
SELECT il.track_id
       ,t.name AS track_name
       ,ar.name AS artist_name
       ,mt.name AS track_type
       ,il.unit_price
       ,il.quantity
  FROM invoice_line il
       INNER JOIN track t
          ON t.track_id = il.track_id
       INNER JOIN media_type mt
          ON mt.media_type_id = t.media_type_id
       INNER JOIN album al
          ON al.album_id = t.album_id
       INNER JOIN artist ar
          ON ar.artist_id = al.artist_id
 WHERE il.invoice_id = 4;
```

## 4: Combining Multiple Joins with Subqueries
```sql
SELECT album, artist, SUM(tracks_purchased) AS tracks_purchased
  FROM (
SELECT ar.name AS artist,
       al.title AS album,
       t.name AS track,
       COUNT(il.quantity) AS tracks_purchased
  FROM track t
       JOIN album al
         ON al.album_id = t.album_id
       JOIN artist ar
         ON ar.artist_id = al.artist_id
       JOIN invoice_line il
         ON il.track_id = t.track_id
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
       )
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC
LIMIT 5
```

## 5: Recursive Joins
```sql
SELECT 
       e1.first_name ||' '|| e1.last_name AS employee_name,
       e1.title AS employee_title,
       e2.first_name ||' '|| e2.last_name AS supervisor_name,
       e2.title AS supervisor_title
  FROM employee e1
       LEFT JOIN employee e2
         ON e2.employee_id = e1.reports_to
ORDER BY 1
```

## 6: Pattern Matching Using LIKE
```sql
SELECT first_name,
       last_name,
       phone
  FROM customer
 WHERE first_name LIKE '%belle%'
```

## 7: Generating Columns With The CASE Statement
```sql
SELECT c.first_name ||' '||c.last_name AS customer_name,
       COUNT(i.invoice_id) AS number_of_purchases,
       SUM(i.total) AS total_spent,
       CASE
          WHEN SUM(i.total) < 40 THEN 'small spender'
          WHEN SUM(i.total) > 100 THEN 'big spender'
          WHEN SUM(i.total) > 40 AND SUM(i.total) <100 THEN 'regular'
       END AS customer_category
  FROM customer c
       JOIN invoice i
         ON i.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```
