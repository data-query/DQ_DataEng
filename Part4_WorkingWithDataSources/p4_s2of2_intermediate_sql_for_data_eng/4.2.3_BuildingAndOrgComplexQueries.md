# Building and Organizing Complex Queries

## 1: Intro
```sql
N/A
```

## 2: Writing Readable Queries
```sql
N/A
```
- See SQL Style Guide https://www.sqlstyle.guide/

## 3: The WITH Clause
```sql
WITH subq AS
(
SELECT p.playlist_id AS playlist_id,
       p.name AS playlist_name,
       t.name AS track_name,
       t.milliseconds/1000 as length_seconds
  from playlist p
       LEFT JOIN playlist_track pt
         ON pt.playlist_id = p.playlist_id
       LEFT JOIN track t
         ON t.track_id = pt.track_id
)
SELECT playlist_id,
       playlist_name,
       COUNT(track_name) AS number_of_tracks,
       SUM(length_seconds) AS length_seconds
  FROM subq
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```

## 4: Creating Views
```sql
CREATE VIEW chinook.customer_gt_90_dollars AS 
    SELECT
        c.*
    FROM chinook.invoice i
    INNER JOIN chinook.customer c ON i.customer_id = c.customer_id
    GROUP BY 1
    HAVING SUM(i.total) > 90;
SELECT * FROM chinook.customer_gt_90_dollars;
```

## 5: Combining Rows With Union
```sql
SELECT * from customer_usa

UNION

SELECT * from customer_gt_90_dollars;
```

## 6: Combining Rows Using Intersect and Except
```sql
WITH customers_usa_gt_90 AS
    (
     SELECT * FROM customer_usa

     INTERSECT

     SELECT * FROM customer_gt_90_dollars
    )

SELECT
    e.first_name || " " || e.last_name employee_name,
    COUNT(c.customer_id) customers_usa_gt_90
FROM employee e
LEFT JOIN customers_usa_gt_90 c ON c.support_rep_id = e.employee_id
WHERE e.title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1;
```

## 7: Multiple Named Subqueries
```sql
WITH
customers_india AS
(
    SELECT *
      FROM customer
     WHERE country = 'India'
),
sales_per_customer AS
(
    SELECT customer_id,
           SUM(total) total
     FROM invoice
    GROUP BY 1
)

SELECT first_name ||' '|| last_name customer_name,
       spc.total AS total_purchases
  FROM customers_india ci
       JOIN sales_per_customer spc
         ON spc.customer_id = ci.customer_id
ORDER BY 1;
         
```

## 8: Challenge: Each Country's Best Customer
```sql
WITH cust_country
AS
(
    SELECT customer_id,
           first_name ||' '||last_name AS customer_name,
           country
      FROM customer
),
cust_purchase AS
(
    SELECT customer_id,
           SUM(total) AS total_purchased
      FROM invoice
    GROUP BY 1
)

SELECT country, customer_name, MAX(total_purchased) AS total_purchased
  FROM cust_country cc
       JOIN cust_purchase cp
         ON cp.customer_id = cc.customer_id
GROUP BY 1
```
