# Subqueries

## 1: Writing More Complex Queries
```sql
SELECT Major, ShareWomen
  FROM recent_grads
 WHERE ShareWomen > 0.5225502029537575
```

## 2: Subqueries
```sql
SELECT Major, Unemployment_rate
  FROM recent_grads
 WHERE Unemployment_rate < (

SELECT AVG(Unemployment_rate)
  FROM recent_grads)
```

## 3: Subquery in SELCET
```sql
SELECT CAST(COUNT(*) AS FLOAT) /
       CAST((SELECT COUNT(*)
               FROM recent_grads
            ) AS FLOAT) AS proportion_abv_avg
  FROM recent_grads
 WHERE ShareWomen > (SELECT AVG(ShareWomen)
                       FROM recent_grads
                    );
```

## 4: The IN Operator
```sql
SELECT Major_category, Major
  FROM recent_grads
 WHERE Major_category IN ('Business', 'Humanities & Liberal Arts', 'Education')
```

## 5: Returning Multiple Results in Subqueries
```sql
 SELECT Major_category, Major
   FROM recent_grads
  WHERE Major_category IN (
 SELECT Major_category
   FROM recent_grads
 GROUP BY Major_category
 ORDER BY SUM(TOTAL) DESC
 LIMIT 3);
```

## 6: Building Complex Subqueries
```sql
SELECT AVG(CAST(Sample_size AS FLOAT) / CAST(Total AS FLOAT)) AS avg_ratio
  FROM recent_grads
```

## 7: Practice Integrating A Subquery With the Outer Query
```sql
SELECT Major, Major_category, 
       CAST(Sample_size AS FLOAT)/Total AS ratio
  FROM recent_grads
 WHERE ratio > (

SELECT AVG(CAST(Sample_size AS FLOAT) / CAST(Total AS FLOAT)) AS avg_ratio
  FROM recent_grads)

SELECT Major, Major_category, 
       CAST(Sample_size AS FLOAT)/Total AS ratio 
  FROM recent_grads 
 WHERE ratio > (SELECT AVG(CAST(Sample_size AS FLOAT)/Total) AS avg_ratio 
                  FROM recent_grads
               );
```
