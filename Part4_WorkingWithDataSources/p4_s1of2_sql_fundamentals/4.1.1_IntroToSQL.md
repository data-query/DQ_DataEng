# Intro to SQL

## 1: Why SQL is Important to Learn
```sql
N/A
```

## 2: Intro to Databases
```sql
N/A
```

## 3: Your First Query
```sql
SELECT *
  FROM recent_grads;
```

## 4: Understanding Your First Query
```sql
SELECT *
  FROM recent_grads;
```

## 5: Previewing a Table
```sql
N/A
```

## 6: The LIMIT Clause
```sql
SELECT *
  FROM recent_grads
 LIMIT 5;
```

## 7: Selecting Specific Columns
```sql
SELECT Major, ShareWomen  
  FROM recent_grads;
```

## 8: Filtering Rows Using WHERE
```sql
SELECT Major, ShareWomen  
  FROM recent_grads 
 WHERE ShareWomen < 0.5;
```

## 9: Expressing Multiple Filter Criteria Using "AND'
```sql
SELECT Major, Major_category, Median, ShareWomen 
  FROM recent_grads 
 WHERE ShareWomen > 0.5 
   AND Median > 50000;
```

## 10: Returning One of Several Conditions With OR
```sql
SELECT Major, Median, Unemployed 
  FROM recent_grads 
 WHERE Median >= 10000 
    OR Men > Women
 LIMIT 20;
```

## 11: Grouping Operators with Parentheses
```sql
SELECT Major, Major_category, ShareWomen, Unemployment_rate
  FROM recent_grads
 WHERE (Major_category = 'Engineering') 
   AND (ShareWomen > 0.5 OR Unemployment_rate < 0.051);
```

## 12: Ordering Results Using ORDER BY
```sql
SELECT Major, ShareWomen, Unemployment_rate 
  FROM recent_grads
 WHERE ShareWomen > 0.3 
   AND Unemployment_rate < .1
 ORDER BY ShareWomen DESC;
```

## 13: Practice Writing a Query
```sql
SELECT Major_category, Major, Unemployment_rate 
    FROM recent_grads 
   WHERE Major_category='Engineering' 
      OR Major_category='Physical Sciences' 
ORDER BY Unemployment_rate;
```
