# Summary Statistics

## 1: Intro
```sql
N/A
```

## 2: A Simple Question
```sql
SELECT MIN(Unemployment_rate)
  FROM recent_grads
```

## 3: Aggregate Functions
```sql
SELECT SUM(Total)
  FROM recent_grads
```

## 4: Order of Execution
```sql
SELECT COUNT(Major)
  FROM recent_grads
 WHERE ShareWomen < 0.5;
```

## 5: Missing Values
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*), COUNT(Unemployment_rate)
  FROM recent_grads
```

## 6: Combining Multiple Aggregate Functions
```sql
SELECT AVG(Total), MIN(Men), MAX(Women)
  FROM recent_grads
```

## 7: Customizing the Results
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'Number of Majors',
       MAX(Unemployment_rate) AS 'Highest Unemployment Rate'
  FROM recent_grads
```

## 8: Counting Unique Values
```sql
SELECT 
       COUNT(DISTINCT Major) AS 'unique_majors', 
       COUNT(DISTINCT Major_category) AS 'unique_major_categories', 
       COUNT(DISTINCT Major_code) AS 'unique_major_codes'
  FROM recent_grads
```

## 9: Data Types
```sql
N/A
```

## 10: String Functions and Operations
```sql
SELECT "Major: "||LOWER(Major) AS "Major", Total, Men, Women, 
       Unemployment_rate, LENGTH(Major) AS "Length_of_name"
  FROM recent_grads
ORDER BY Unemployment_rate DESC
```

## 11: Peforming Arithmetic in SQL
```sql
SELECT Major, Major_category, P75th-P25th AS "quartile_spread"
  FROM recent_grads
ORDER BY 3 ASC
LIMIT 20
```
