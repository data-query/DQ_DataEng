# Group Summary Statistics

## 1: Intro
```sql
N/A
```

## 2: If/Then in SQL
```sql
SELECT 
       CASE
          WHEN Sample_size < 200 THEN 'Small'
          WHEN (Sample_size >= 200 AND
               Sample_size < 1000) THEN 'Medium'
          WHEN Sample_size >= 1000 THEN 'Large'
       END AS 'Sample_category'
  FROM recent_grads
```

## 3: Dissecting CASE
```sql
SELECT Major,
       Sample_size,
       CASE
          WHEN Sample_size < 200 THEN 'Small'
          WHEN (Sample_size >= 200 AND
               Sample_size < 1000) THEN 'Medium'
          WHEN Sample_size >= 1000 THEN 'Large'
       END AS 'Sample_category'
  FROM recent_grads
SELECT Major, Sample_size,
       CASE
       WHEN Sample_size < 200 THEN 'Small'
       WHEN Sample_size < 1000 THEN 'Medium'
       ELSE 'Large'
       END AS Sample_category
  FROM recent_grads;
```

## 4: Calculating Group-Level Summary Stats
```sql
SELECT Major_category, SUM(Total) AS Total_graduates
  FROM recent_grads
GROUP BY Major_category
```

## 5: GROUP BY Visual Breakdown
```sql
SELECT Major_category, AVG(ShareWomen) AS Average_women
  FROM recent_grads
GROUP BY Major_category
```

## 6: Multiple Summary Stats by Group
```sql
SELECT Major_category, 
       SUM(Women) AS Total_women,
       AVG(ShareWomen) AS Mean_women,
       SUM(Total)*AVG(ShareWomen) AS Estimate_women
  FROM recent_grads
GROUP BY Major_category
```

## 7: Multiple Group Columns
```sql
SELECT Major_category, Sample_category, 
       AVG(ShareWomen) AS Mean_women,
       SUM(Total) AS Total_graduates
  FROM new_grads
GROUP BY Major_category,
         Sample_category
```

## 8: Querying Virtual Columns With the HAVING Statement
```sql
SELECT Major_category, AVG(Low_wage_jobs) / AVG(Total) AS Share_low_wage
  FROM new_grads
GROUP BY Major_category
HAVING Share_low_wage > .1
```

## 9: Order of Execution
- FROM
- WHERE
- GROUP BY
- HAVING
- SELECT
- ORDER BY
- LIMIT

## 10: Rounding Results With The ROUND Function
```sql
SELECT ROUND(ShareWomen, 4) AS Rounded_women,
       Major_category
  FROM new_grads
LIMIT 10;
```

## 11: Nesting Functions
```sql
SELECT Major_category,
       ROUND(AVG(College_jobs) / AVG(Total), 3) AS Share_degree_jobs
  FROM new_grads
GROUP BY Major_category
HAVING Share_degree_jobs < .3
```

## 12: Casting
```sql
SELECT Major_category,
       CAST(SUM(Women) AS Float) / CAST(SUM(Total) AS Float) AS SW
  FROM new_grads
GROUP BY Major_category
ORDER BY SW
```
